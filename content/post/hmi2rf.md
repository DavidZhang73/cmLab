Join us at ANU Computer Science and the [HMI](https://hmi.anu.edu.au/) project!

<!--more-->

Position highlights

* Outstanding opportunity to work in the Humanising Machine Intelligence Project (https://hmi.anu.edu.au/).
* Develop theory, algorithms and applications for collective behaviour and human-AI joint decision making.
* Work on socio-technical problems that spans the collective team expertise in Computer Science, Philosophy, Social and Political Sciences and Law.

The Research Fellows will be a member of the School of Computing and part of the HMI project. Their position is fixed term for a 2 year appointment to contribute to the Humanising Machine Intelligence project, in collaboration with CSIRO Data61.

The HMI is a major cross-disciplinary project at the ANU, uniting a team of computer scientists, philosophers, and social scientists in the pursuit of a more ethical future of machine intelligence. We share a common expertise in data-driven decision-making under uncertainty, though coming from different perspectives. Such a multi-disciplinary background provides a holistic view of AI, data science and automated decision-making that the team, including the to-be-appointed Research Fellow, can leverage.

Applications are particularly invited from researchers with a wide range of technical backgrounds, including but not limited to machine learning, optimisation and operations research, HCI, computational social choice and game theory, decision theory, information theory, and reinforcement learning. Though these positions will be housed in the School of Computing, we strongly encourage anyone who meets the selection criteria to apply.
